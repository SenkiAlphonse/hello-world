# hello-world

Hey, 

I'm training to become a software developer, I'm interested in agile methodology and scrum, and I'm learning Python in my free time. 
I'm also in mid-changing my professional career to the above mentioned field.
I expect I'll become active here as soon as I get to start some projects with my newly found knowledge :)
